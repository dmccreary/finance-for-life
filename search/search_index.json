They keep doing this until they find something that would have worked great in the past.\"</p> <p>\"But that doesn't mean it will work in the future,\" Alex realized.</p> <p>\"Exactly!

He showed that once you account for selection bias, survivorship bias, and the high fees of active management, the average actively managed fund actually underperforms the market.\"</p> <p>\"Is that why index funds have become so popular?\" Alex asked.</p> <p>\"Absolutely.
