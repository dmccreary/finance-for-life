### Rental Car Insurance Types

The are typically three insurance options offered by car rental companies. These options differ in what they cover and how much protection they provide.

1.  **Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)/Loss Damage Waiver (LDW)**

- This is not technically insurance but a waiver where the rental company agrees not to hold you financially responsible for damage to the rental vehicle
- Covers repair costs if the rental car is damaged in a collision
- Usually has exclusions for negligence, off-road driving, or driving under the influence
- May have a deductible you'd still need to pay

2.  **Liability Insurance/Supplemental Liability Protection (SLP)**

- Covers damage you might cause to other people's property or injuries to others
- Provides protection beyond what your personal auto insurance might offer
- Important for coverage against potentially expensive liability claims
- Coverage limits vary by company but typically range from $1 million to $2 million

3.  **Personal Accident Insurance/Personal Effects Coverage (PAI/PEC)**

-   Covers medical costs for you and your passengers if injured in an accident
-   Often includes coverage for personal belongings that might be stolen from or damaged in the rental car
-   Typically has lower coverage limits compared to the other options
-   May be redundant if you have health insurance and homeowners/renters insurance

It's worth noting that your personal auto insurance policy and certain credit cards may already provide some of these coverages, so it's a good idea to check your existing policies before purchasing additional coverage from the rental company.

    I live in the state of Minnesota.  Minnesota law requires all driver insurance policies to cover some of these items.  Which items are automatically covered by law in Minnesota?  Does it make any financial sense to get any of these?

## Claude Anthropic With Internet Search Option Response

I'll need to search for the specific Minnesota auto insurance requirements to give you accurate information about what's automatically covered by law.

Based on my search, Minnesota law provides extensive automatic coverage for rental cars through your personal auto insurance policy, which means you may not need to purchase additional coverage from rental companies.

Under Minnesota law, all auto insurance policies must cover damage to a rental vehicle and loss of use of the vehicle, and extend the policy's basic economic loss benefits, residual liability insurance, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.

This means if you have valid auto insurance in Minnesota, your policy automatically covers:

1.  **Collision Damage Waiver (CDW)/Loss Damage Waiver (LDW)**: Minnesota law requires every auto insurance policy to include a minimum of $35,000 in coverage---without a deductible---for damage to a rental car. This means the CDW/LDW offered by rental companies is generally unnecessary.

2.  **Liability Insurance**: Your personal policy's liability coverage extends to rental cars, making the Supplemental Liability Protection (SLP) redundant for most drivers.

3.  **Personal Accident Insurance**: Your Personal Injury Protection (PIP) coverage will apply if you're injured while driving a rental car. This makes the rental company's personal accident insurance unnecessary.

From a financial perspective, purchasing additional coverage from the rental company typically doesn't make sense for Minnesota residents with valid auto insurance. Minnesota law even prohibits car rental companies from selling collision damage waivers or other insurance products unless you acknowledge in writing that you understand your personal auto insurance already covers the rental.

However, there are two situations where additional coverage might be worth considering:

1.  If you're renting a car in another country (your Minnesota policy may not extend internationally)
2.  If you want coverage for liability that exceeds the amount provided by your personal policy

Before renting, I'd recommend calling your insurance provider to confirm your specific coverage details.
