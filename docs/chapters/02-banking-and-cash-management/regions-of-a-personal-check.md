Here's a numbered list of the **key regions of a personal check**:

1.  **Date Line** -- Located at the top right corner. This is where the date of the check is written.

2.  **Payee Line** -- Usually preceded by "Pay to the Order of," this line is where the recipient's name or business is written.

3.  **Numeric Amount Box** -- A small box on the right side where the check amount is written in numeric format (e.g., 100.00).

4.  **Written Amount Line** -- Below the payee line, this is where the check amount is written out in words to prevent fraud or errors.

5.  **Memo Line (Optional)** -- Located at the bottom left, this line is used to write a note or reference about the purpose of the payment.

6.  **Signature Line** -- Located at the bottom right, this is where the account holder signs to authorize the check.

7.  **Check Number** -- Typically found at the top right and also in the MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition) line at the bottom, identifying the specific check.

8.  **Bank Information** -- This section, usually located at the bottom center, contains the bank's name and address.

9.  **Routing Number** -- Found at the bottom left in the MICR line, this 9-digit number identifies the financial institution.

10.  **Account Number** -- Located immediately after the routing number in the MICR line, this number identifies the account from which funds will be withdrawn.

11.  **MICR Line** -- The sequence of numbers at the bottom of the check, which includes the routing number, account number, and check number, encoded in magnetic ink for processing.
