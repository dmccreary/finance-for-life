## Historical Context

The chart clearly shows several important periods in US monetary policy over the last three decades including the "insurance cuts" in the mid-1990s under Greenspan, the dot-com bubble and bust, the near-zero rates following the 2008 financial crisis, and the dramatic rate hikes beginning in 2022 to combat high inflation [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/history-of-federal-funds-rate/).

Some key patterns visible in the data:

1. The significant drop after the 2001 recession and dot-com crash
2. The extended period of near-zero rates from 2009-2015 following the financial crisis
3. The dramatic reduction in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the aggressive series of rate hikes beginning in 2022 that brought rates to their highest level since 2007 [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187616/effective-rate-of-us-federal-funds-monthly/)[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/247941/federal-funds-rate-level-in-the-united-states/)
4. The beginning of rate cuts in late 2024 that brought the rate down to 4.48% by December [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187616/effective-rate-of-us-federal-funds-monthly/)

The chart provides insight into how the Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a tool for monetary policy, adjusting them in response to economic conditions like inflation, unemployment, and financial market stability.
