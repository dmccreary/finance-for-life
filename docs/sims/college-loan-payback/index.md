## Actual Figures for 2025

### Annual College Costs

The annual “sticker price” of a year at a private undergraduate college in 2025 is expected to be $57,000.

By 2029, the average “sticker price” for a private four-year college could approach 
$65,000–$70,000 per year.

### Student Loan Interest Rates Averages

According to Education.org, for the 2023–2024 academic year, the average undergraduate direct loan rate was 6.53%.  This is the highest rate ever for college loans.

For Federal Student Loans for undergraduates, the federal Direct Loan interest rates have fluctuated between roughly 3.7% and 5.5% in recent years, tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.

### Annual Cost for Trade Schools

On average, one might see $10,000–$15,000 per year for many trade school programs.

## Sample Prompt

!!! prompt
    Create a new MicroSim that helps students calculate how long in years and months it would need to pay back a college loan.  Use input controls for number of years in college (1 to 6), cost per year in college (default of $50K) with a rage control of values from $1K to $120K, Interest rate estimate in percentage using known averages as the defaults, and monthly payment after college.  Add a "Calculate" button that will show the calculation intermediate results and the total time to pay back the debt.

    Remember to use the MicroSim width-responsive Generation Rules in the Project Knowledge area so that the graphics and sliders adjust to the container size.
