# Concept Taxonomy

Please create a taxonomy to help us categorize each concept in our 04conceptlist.csv file in the Project knowledge area.   I would like you to create a 10 to 12 element taxonomy to classify each of the concepts in this course.  Each concept will only have a single taxonomy as the primary classifier.

The first category will be Foundational Concepts which are not dependant on any other concepts.

Consider using these other categories you have also discovered:

Banking concepts

Credit and debt concepts

Tax concepts

Insurance concepts

Investment concepts

Market concepts

Life stage financial planning

Consider using "Capstone Projects" as one category as projects students can work on in teams for the last two weeks of the course where they become "Financial Planners".

Feel free to add "Miscellaneous Concepts" if you find concepts don't fit well into any of the other concepts.

## Response

I'll create a taxonomy to help categorize the concepts in your Finance for Life course. Based on the course description, the Bloom's taxonomy version, and your suggested categories, here's a comprehensive taxonomy structure with 12 categories:
