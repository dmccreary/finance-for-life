# List of MicroSims



!!! prompt
    I would like to build a series of MicroSims (simulations created with p5.js that run in the browser) for the this chapter in a Personal Finance course:

    Please describe a series of MicroSims written in P5.js that would be engaging for high school students and make these topics fun.  For each MicroSim list the following:

    - The MicroSim title
    - The subject areas or topics
    - The audience age (junior high to high school)
    - The learning goals of the microsim
    - A list of the input controls the student would change
    - A way to measure if the student understands the topics
