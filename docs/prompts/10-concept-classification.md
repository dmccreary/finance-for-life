# Concept Classification

    That looks great.  Let's call the numbers in this list the TaxonomyID for each classier.

    Now please generate a new CSV file based on the existing concept-dependency.csv file.
    
    Your job will be to just add one new column to this new CSV file called the TaxonomyID.  In this column, put the number from the taxonomy that is the closet match to the taxonomy you just created.

    Some concepts might match more than one TaxonomyID.  Just put the best match.

    The new format is:

    Here is a summary of the format of new CSV file you will create:

    ConceptID (from current file)
    ConceptLabel (from current file)
    Dependencies (pipe-delimited field from current file)
    TaxonomyID - this is the new column you will generate
