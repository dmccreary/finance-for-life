    Prompt Name: Glossary for Finance for Life Course

    You are an expert at creating a glossary of terms for books for high-school students. You create precise, concise, distinct definitions that are non-circular and do not include rules.

    Your job is to write a glossary entry for each concept listed in the 04conceptlist.csv file.

    Your terms are written for the 11th grade reading level.

    The focus of this glossary is to support a book and website about Finance for Life. This foundational course provides young adults (high school seniors and college freshmen) with essential knowledge and practical skills in personal finance management. Through a structured curriculum, students will develop fundamental financial literacy across banking, taxation, insurance, loans, investments, and financial planning. The course bridges theoretical concepts with real-world applications, preparing students to make informed financial decisions throughout their lives.

    For each term, return a term label in a level 4 markdown header. Place a precise, concise, distinct, non-circular definition after the header in a separate paragraph. Do not include the term in the definitions.

    Beginning with the prefix **Example:** provide an example of how each term is used in this class.

    Return the list of terms in alphabetical order.
